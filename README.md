Anaplasma_sloth_infections
This repository provides the dataset, R command lines and scripts used for the statistical analyses in the manuscript 'High prevalence of asymptomatic anaplasmosis in wild sloths' by Duron et al. 

In this study, we used data from clinical evaluations conducted in French Guiana to investigate the effect of infection with *Anaplasma amazonensis* in wild brown-throated sloths (*Bradypus tridactylus*) and Linnaeusâ€™s two-toed sloths (*Choloepus didactylus*).
