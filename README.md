# Anaplasma_sloth_infections
This repository provides the R command lines and scripts used for the statistical analyses in the manuscript 'High prevalence of asymptomatic anaplasmosis in wild sloths' by Duron et al. 

In this study, we used data from clinical evaluations conducted in French Guiana to investigate the effect of infection with *Anaplasma amazonensis* in wild brown-throated sloths (*Bradypus tridactylus*) and Linnaeus’s two-toed sloths (*Choloepus didactylus*). Specifically, we analyzed data from 175 wild sloths captured between 1994 and 1995 during the flooding of the Petit Saut Dam. These veterinary clinical data include the following variables: 
- species: Sloth species (Bt: *Bradypus tridactylus*; Cd: *Choloepus didactylus*)
- sex: Sex of the sloth (F: Female; M: Male)
- age_class: Age category (A: Adult; J: Juvenile)
- season: Season of capture (W: Wet; D: Dry)
- weight: Body weight (continuous variable, in kg)
- total_length: Total body length (continuous variable, in cm)
- wither_height: Height at the withers (continuous variable, in cm)
- neck_size: Neck circumference (continuous variable, in cm)
- temperature: Body temperature (continuous variable, in °C)
- hematocrit: Hematocrit level (continuous variable, in %)
- health_condition: Overall health status (G: Good; D: Deteriorated)
- anaplasma: Infection status with *Anaplasma* (0: Uninfected; 1: Infected)
- tick: Presence of ticks in the fur (0: Absent; 1: Present)
- microfilaria: Infection status with microfilariae (0: Uninfected; 1: Infected)
- trypanosome: Infection status with trypanosomes (0: Uninfected; 1: Infected)
- babesia: Infection status with _Babesia_ (0: Uninfected; 1: Infected)
- blood_parasites: Combined infection status for blood parasites (microfilariae + trypanosome + Babesia)
